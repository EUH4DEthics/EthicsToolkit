The purpose of the file structure and the verification form to provide a
basic guidelines to the requirements necessary for regulatory and
ethical compliance of experiments as well as to systematize the evidence
required for projects within a cascade funding activity such as
EUHubs4Data. The evidence summary at the end can be used as a project
management tool to e.g. approve execution or pay-out based on the
evidences collected.
