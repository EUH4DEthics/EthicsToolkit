This was the ethics review proceedure adapted per experiment in the EUHubs4Data Project


1. Randomly assign 2 reporting reviewers per proposal
2. First level of checks (each reviewer), non-compliance leads to reject without discussion 
  - [ ] if applicable: previous review comments addressed 
  - [ ] data management plan consistent with ethics self-assessment
  - [ ] evidence derived from ethics self-assessment complete
3. Second level of checks
  - [ ] uncontrolled/undeclared ethical risks identified
  - [ ] mitigations seem appropriate
  - [ ] needs discussion 
4. Discussion with external advisor
  - [ ] Recommendations 


Each step was repeated before project start, mid-term and at final review. Particularly changes in the data management plans were detected and previous recommendation and mitigations were monitored
